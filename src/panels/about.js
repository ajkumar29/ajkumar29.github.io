        I am self-motivated, hardworking and passionate about technology. I have
        all-round technical skills combined with good practical knowledge of
        analysing and solving problems using programming. I enjoy honing my
        programming skillset by solving challenges and developing applications
        in my spare time. I use my questioning skills to analyse and break down
        complex problems to implement efficient solutions. I am comfortable
        working in a dynamic, team-based environment and where necessary, I can
        also deliver results working independently.
